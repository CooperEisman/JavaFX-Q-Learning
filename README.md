# JavaFX-Q-Learning
A Java Repo with GUI to demonstrate QLearning in a Maze

QLearning Code Adapted From technobium's Q-Learning on Github: https://github.com/technobium/q-learning-java/blob/master/src/main/java/com/technobium/rl/QLearning.java


What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
  In QLearning, the 'Q' stands for the type of equation that the algorithim uses, and the Leanring signifies that the algorithim learns from an input to create an output.
  
What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
  Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML. Essentially, it entails providing the agent with a Reward for its actions, allowing it to find the option with highest reward.
  
What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
  Model Free means that the algorithim does not require a model of the enviroment in order to function.
  
What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
  TO me, it seems that QLearning is very useful as a way to run a simple Neural Net, without a terrible amount of reosurces required to run it. I stuggled to find real life comparisons.
